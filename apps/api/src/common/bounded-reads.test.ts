/**
 * v2.10 S2 — the rule, enforced.
 *
 * An unbounded `findMany` on a table that grows with a customer's data is
 * invisible at demo scale and a multi-megabyte response at real scale. The
 * v2.10 baseline found `/stock/levels` returning 589 KB for 2,000 rows.
 *
 * This test is the reason that cannot quietly come back. Every unbounded query
 * on a tenant-scaled model must either be fixed or listed below WITH A REASON.
 * Adding a line to the allowlist is a deliberate act that shows up in review;
 * forgetting a `take:` is not.
 *
 * It scans source rather than behaviour on purpose: the same shape as
 * `model-policy.test.ts`, which catches a new soft-deletable model the same way.
