/**
 * v2.10 S3 — the measurement lane.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT part of any automatic run: it needs the load tenant present
 * and takes minutes. It exists because the background jobs had no measurement
 * at all, which is how `runStockSweep` came to reload every movement ever
 * recorded once per stock level without anyone noticing. A job nobody times is
 * a job whose cost nobody knows.
 *
 * It is a vitest lane rather than a plain script because Nest DI needs emitted
 * decorator metadata, and both tsx and esbuild drop it — the same reason the
 * integration lanes carry the swc plugin.
 *
 *   pnpm --filter @techpioasset/api perf:sweep
